abstract: Mainly based on the application of SAGE parameter extraction method, the indoor millimeter wave non line of sight channel measurement research is carried out. Firstly, the vector network analyzer is used to obtain the time delay, phase shift, amplitude and other parameters of multipath signal transmission, and the impulse response of the signal in time domain is obtained by using these parameters. Then, the impulse response data is sorted out, and the channel parameters such as delay, horizontal angle of arrival and vertical angle of arrival are obtained from the channel impulse response by using SAGE parameter extraction method. Finally, the channel transmission characteristics are obtained by analyzing the path delay and angle of arrival. The research results provide guidance for indoor millimeter wave channel measurement and modeling.
