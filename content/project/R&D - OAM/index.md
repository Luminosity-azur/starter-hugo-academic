## Research Background
With the development of the first generation mobile communication network to the fifth generation mobile communication network, in order to cope with the growth of capacity demand, the industry has proposed multiplexing communication technologies based on orthogonal resources such as time, frequency, codeword and space. With the further development of communication technology, the sixth generation mobile communication system will face higher capacity requirements in the future. In recent years, the modal resource based on orbital angular momentum is considered as a new spatial degree of freedom. This paper focuses on the orbital angular momentum wireless communication and studies its mode multiplexing.

## Definition of OAM

Angular momentum is composed of spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). The spin angular momentum is only related to the spin of photons, and it is in a circularly polarized state. Orbital angular momentum represents the rotation of electrons around the propagation axis, which is generated by the energy flow (described by Poynting vector) rotating around the optical axis. It makes the phase wavefront of the electromagnetic wave in a vortex shape. Therefore, the electromagnetic wave carrying orbital angular momentum is also called vortex electromagnetic wave.

## Model performance analysis
The following is the simulation part. First, the analysis of the simulation results of the tilt model. The figure shows the relationship between the system capacity and the tilt angle. It can be seen that with the increase of the tilt angle, the channel capacity shows an overall downward trend.
